== Prerequisites

=== General

WARNING: You must have have access privileges to this software before you
can access this software. Please contact Ribose administrators if you do not.

This repository contains documents that require the private Metanorma-PLATEAU
package.

There are two ways to access the Metanorma-PLATEAU software.

=== Via private package

==== Obtain a GitHub authentication token

A GitHub authentication token is needed to install this package.
Please follow the following steps.

. On https://github.com, click on your profile picture on the top right
and click on "Settings".
. Click on "Developer settings" at the bottom of the navigation bar
. Click on "Personal access tokens", then "Tokens (classic)"
. Click the "Generate new token" button, then "Generate new token (classic)"
. Now prompted with a form, choose a name for the token, set expiration (usual caveats apply),
and select at least the scope `read:packages`. This allows the new token to access
private packages.

NOTE: Make sure you create a "personal access token (classic)" which is the only
form of token the
https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-rubygems-registry[GitHub private Rubygems package registry]
supports!

This token is to be used in your Gem *and* Bundler authentication (see https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-rubygems-registry[GitHub's page] for details).

// ==== Configure Rubygems authentication

// This is the first location to install the token.

// Create a file `~/.gem/credentials` to house your token:

// [source,yaml]
// ----
// ---
// :github: Bearer ghp_BEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEF
// ----

==== Configure Bundler authentication

// This is the second location to install the token.

Run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
bundle config https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/metanorma YOURUSERNAME:ghp_BEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEF
----

To verify if it worked, check your `$HOME/.bundle/config` file
that it contains this line:

[source,yaml]
----
---
BUNDLE_GEM__CI: "github"
BUNDLE_GEM__CHANGELOG: "false"
BUNDLE_RUBYGEMS__PKG__GITHUB__COM: "MyGitHubUsername:ghp_BEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEF" <1>
BUNDLE_GEM__LINTER: "rubocop"
----
<1> Check if this exists!

=== Via source code

==== Setup Git authentication with GitHub

Please refer to these guides. We recommend using SSH over HTTPS to
authentication against GitHub due to stability.

SSH:

* https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent]
* https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account[Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account]

==== Configuring the document repository

Metanorma document repositories are configured by default to use private packages,
not development source code.

In order to use development source code, you would need to authenticate with
GitHub through Git.

To use SSH or HTTP for GitHub authentication, you will need to edit the
`Gemfile` located at the root of the document repository.

[source,ruby]
----
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "metanorma-plateau", source: "https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/metanorma" <1>
gem "metanorma-cli"
----
<1> This line uses the privately published package. Line to replace.

If you use SSH, change to:

[source,ruby]
----
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "metanorma-plateau", git: "git@github.com:metanorma/metanorma-plateau.git" <1>
gem "metanorma-cli"
----
<1> Replaced line

If using HTTPS, change to:

[source,ruby]
----
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "metanorma-plateau", github: "metanorma/metanorma-plateau" <1>
gem "metanorma-cli"
----
<1> Replaced line


Then run the `bundle` command to fetch the development code.


== Usage (general)

=== Installing Metanorma

See https://www.metanorma.org

=== Fetching the document

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-plateau/
----

=== Building the document

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----


== Converting documents from HTML

Steps:

. Install `coradoc` (run `bundle install`)
. Obtain the `index.html` from https://www.mlit.go.jp/plateaudocument02/
. Load the page entirely, and then copy/paste the HTML DOM content into
a new `index.html` file.
. Run the `reverse_adoc` command:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec reverse_adoc -rcoradoc/reverse_adoc/plugins/plateau --split-sections 2 --external-images -o sources/001-v4/document.adoc reference-docs/plateau-document-01.html
----

Where:

`reference-docs/plateau-document-01.html`:: is the input document
`-o plateau-document-01/index.adoc`:: is the output document path
`--split-sections`:: means to split files at Clause level 2
`--external-images`:: means to extract out all images to separate files
`-rcoradoc/reverse_adoc/plugins/plateau`:: applies Plateau-specific conversions




== Editor usage

=== Convert images from webp to PNG

Some PLATEAU documents utilize webp images.

Due to https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-plateau/issues/7 , the PDF renderer we use, Apache FOP, does not support webp images.

Hence at import we have to convert all webp images into PNG.

Converting with parallel processing: (if you have GNU Parallel)

[source,sh]
----
$ parallel dwebp {} -o {}.png ::: *.webp
----

Converting sequentially:

[source,sh]
----
$ find . -name "*.webp" -exec dwebp \{} -o \{}.png
----

Updating the files to refer to the new `.png` files:

[source,sh]
----
sed -i '' 's/\.webp/.webp.png/g' sources/001-v3/sections/*.adoc
----


=== Running via Docker or locally

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -w /metanorma -it metanorma/metanorma metanorma site generate
----
